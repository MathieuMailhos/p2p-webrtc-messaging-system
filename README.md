# P2P Messaging System based on WebRTCThis repo implements a simple messaging system accross web browsers. It is using WebRTC technology to allow direct communications between clients.A third party is used to let the devices learn where the remote peer is located on the Internet: this is the signaling process. Once they have exchanged their contact information, the signaling server is not used anymore during the conversation.The repo is hosting a simple webchat UI with its client.js and a signaling server. The signaling server is made in Go. The current version (08/07) is only usable with Google Chrome but an update is planned in the incoming hours/days. ![chat room][https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5645869/16680860/673b120a-44a6-11e6-8d65-1d3c8c384034.png]## Install & RunMake sure Go is [correctly configured](https://golang.org/doc/install) and install the dependency first:```go get github.com/gorilla/mux```Start your signaling server:```go run signaling.go```## Simple testing processOpen your browser and access to the chat by opening index.html. Open a second tab for easy testing.Log in with 'User A'Log in with 'User B'From 'User A', establish a connection with 'User B'.Happy chatting!## Roadmap* Handling Firefox and Opera browsers (client side)* Improving exception handlings on client and server sides* Improving connections concurrencies on server side* Encrypt signaling websocket with TLS ([and more](http://webrtc-security.github.io/)) * Bash or Python test suite## Suggestions - ContactAny suggestions, comments, questions, ideas of features or advices for improvements are great welcome! Please send me a message on Twitter @mathieumailhos.## Contributors- Mathieu Mailhos## References - [Google.IO WebRTC Introduction Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ci91dfKCyc)- [WebRTC API Doc](http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/apis/webrtc)
